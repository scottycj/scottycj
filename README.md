- 👋 Hi, I’m @scottycj
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, anime, sci-fi, and fantasy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and C# for the sake of game development in college.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Unreal Engine 4 anime-inspired character action RPG, though I don't really have any code for gameplay written ATM since I'm focusing on writing the story right now.
- 📫 How to reach me:
- Discord: coolzie#3215 (you'll have to ask me here on GitHub before friending me so that I know you're not a scammer or w/e.)
